##  :sparkles:About
This project is a tag-based recommender system designed for Sims 4 Custom Content (CC) discovery.  All you have to do is enter keywords like "loveseat" or  "sneakers" and receive curated links to CC downloads. It supports partial matching across style, category, creator, and descriptive tags, making it flexible and intuitive for players with diverse tastes.

Built entirely in Python, this recommender was created to help players find CC that fits their aesthetic without scrolling endlessly through forums or download sites. It’s fast, customizable, and built by an avid Sims 4 CC player.
